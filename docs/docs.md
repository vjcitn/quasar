# Usage

To run **quasar**, use the command `./quasar` on the command line after installation. Flags and options specify how quasar will run. 

To list all the possible options and see quasar's help you can run: 

```
./quasar --help
```

To see the version of quasar you are using run: 

```
./quasar --version
```

## Quickstart

We recommend running quasar to perform cis-eQTL mapping using the negative binomial model and adjusted profile likelihood estimation of the negative binomial dispersion parameter. To run quasar in this mode use the command: 

```
./quasar --plink plink_prefix \
    --bed phenotype_data.bed \
    --cov covariate_data.tsv \
    --mode cis \
    --model nb_glm \
    --use-apl \
    --out nb_fit
```

## QTL mapping modes

The quasar software can be run in three modes: `cis`, `trans`, `gwas`. These modes specify which varaints are tested for asscociation with a particular feature. 

In mode `cis` variants within +- the window size of the gene (see phenotype data format for details). By default the window size is set to 1Mb but can be specified using the `--window_size` flag. We refer to this set of variants as the cis-window for that feature. 

In mode `trans` all variants except those in the cis window are tested for assoication. In mode `gwas` all variants are are tested for association. 

Note that during the development of quasar the `cis` mode was tested more extensively than the `trans` and `gwas` modes and that there are methodological issues with trans-eQTL mapping due to reads mapping to multiple locations causing false-positive associations. 

## Statistical models

The quasar software package supports a wide range of statistical models used to resiudalise the expression values. The supported models are:

* `lm`: linear model
* `nb_glm`: negative binomial GLM 
* `lmm`: linear mixed model
* `p_glmm`: Poisson generalised linear mixed model (GLMM)
* `p_glm`: Poisson GLM (**not recommended** due to producing a very high rate of false positives)
* `nb_glmm`: negative binomial GLMM (**not generally recommended** due to producing highly similar results to the Poisson GLMM while being slower, can be used if there is known to be high relatedness between samples)

When the model is a mixed model i.e. is specified to be any of `lmm`, `p_glmm`, `nb_glmm` the --grm flag (see below) must be used to specify a genetic relatedness matrix used in the covarariance matrix of the random effects. 

When the `nb_glm` or `nb_glmm` flags are specified the --use-apl flag can be specified to use the Cox-Reid adjusted profile likelihood (APL) when estimating the negative binomial dispersion paraemter. Use of the APL is recommended as it reduces the number of false-positives but is slightly slower than standard maximum likelihood estimation.

## Data formats

### Genotype data

--plink/-p

The genotype data should be in plink2 binary format with .bed/.bim/.fam files named plink_prefix.bed/.bim/.fam

The .bed/.bim/.fam files can be generated from vcf using the following command

```sh
plink2 \
    --output-chr chrX \
    --vcf ${plink_prefix}.vcf.gz \
    --out ${plink_prefix}
```

If using --make-bed with PLINK 1.9 or earlier, add the --keep-allele-order flag.

### Phenotype data

--bed/-b

The phenotype data is a tab-seperated file with where rows are features and the first four
columns give feature information and the rest are sample ids are the sample ids. For example, 

```
#chr      start         end      phenotype_id  sample_1   sample_2   sample_3 ...
   1  113871759   113813811   ENSG00000134242      39           43         45 ...
 ...
```

The start and end values are used to specify the centre of the cis-window. To specify the gene TSS as the centre of the window, set TSS = start, end = start + 1, so that the cis-window is [TSS - window, TSS + window + 1] or alternatively set the start and end values to the start and end of the gene so that the cis-window is [start - window, end + window].

For the count based models (i.e. `nb_glm`, `p_glm`, `p_glmm` and `nb_glmm`) count data should be passed to quasar. This can be either RNA-seq counts or pseudobulk scRNA-seq counts (the sum of the counts over the inidivdual). For the linear models (i.e. `lm` and `lmm`) we recommend that when analysing scRNA-seq counts the mean over individuals is passed to quasar.

### Covariate data

--cov/-c

The covariate data is a tab-separated file with rows as samples and first column `sample_id` and other columns containing the covariates. For example,

```
sample_id   covariate_1     covariate_2 ...
 sample_1             1             5.4 ...
 sample_2             1             3.1 ...
      ...
```

### Genetic relatedness matrix

--grm/-g

A tab separated text file contaning the genetic relatedness-matrix in matrix fomat. For example, 

```
sample_id sample_1 sample_2 sample_3 sample_4 ...
  sample_1       1	   0.18     0.03     -0.3 
  sample_2     0.1	      1      0.4      0.1
  sample_3    0.04	   0.45        1      0.1
  sample_4    -0.1	    0.4        0        1 ...
       ...
```

To construct the GRM we recommend using the plink2 --make-king command after pruning variants.

## Output

quasar produces two files:

* {out-prefix}-quasar-variant.txt which contains variant information
* {out-prefix}-quasar-cis-region.txt which contains gene information

### Variant output

The variant level output of quasar has the following basic format:

```
     feature_id            snp_id     chrom       pos      alt     ref     maf     beta     se     pvalue
ENSG00000100181    22:16849971A-T        22  16849971        T      A     0.39    0.012  0.038     0.7385
           ...
```

In the output the `alt` allele is the effect allele. Other columns including `glm_converged`, `glmm_converged`, `phi`, `phi_converged` encode information about the gene-level models fit to the expression data and are included depending on the type of model used.

### Region level output

```
     feature_id     chrom       start       end     pvalue
ENSG00000100181        22    17082776  17082777   0.796123
ENSG00000069998        22    17646176  17646177  0.0388123
            ...
```

In this output, the pvalue is computed by applying the Aggregated Cauchy Association Test to the variant-level pvalues in the region.

These files are written into the directory which quasar is run in.
